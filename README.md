# Throw Slimeballs

Add a funny twist to the gameplay throwing slimeballs and magma cream with unique effects!

* **Throw slimeballs and magma cream:** Use `mcl_mobitems:slimeball` and `mcl_mobitems:magma_cream` as throwable projectiles with new mechanics.
* **Slimeballs:** Spawn small slimes when impacting on entities or players, creating helpers or chaos around you.
* **Magma Cream:** Ignites randomly fire where it lands and slides along surfaces instead of bouncing.

* **Bounce physics:** Projectiles bounce naturally upon hitting surfaces, adding dynamic interactions.
